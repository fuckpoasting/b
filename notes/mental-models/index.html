To some extent - including me. Ever since I was 14, I&rsquo;ve had to make
a major life decision every ~2 years that would radically shape the
way I perceive and interact with the world, but only the last two
decisions have been made based on a mental model that I forced
myself to sit down and stitch together based on my own set of values
and beliefs.</p><p>It was prompted partially by a series of situations I got myself into
during the final year of university, which had me facing decision
fatigue and existential dread. I care a lot about what I do with my
life, and choosing what to work on is, by principle, a big decision to me.
To simplify and inform my choice, I read through a bunch of blogs on
techno-optimism and ethics (reboot, gwern, noah smith etc), but mainly
this
<a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.4360.pdf rel=noopener>paper</a> by Schmidhuber
(mentioned I think in a geothotz interview) was a pretty impactful read.</p><p>A lot of people try too hard to adapt generic value frameworks
from the people around them and jam their entire life, psyche and
ambitions into it and hope it pays off. Now, I am not
saying you can&rsquo;t be inspired by other people, reflect and iterate on
your worldview but rather it is unlikely that someone else&rsquo;s framework
is going to work for you, because you are completely different people.
It works for some people, but drastically fails for others.</p><p>Some notable examples include:</p><ul><li>Asians going to STEM / Indians going to IIT because
of their parents</li><li>Andrew Tate/Sigma Grindset gang</li></ul><p>There&rsquo;s also another problem, where people are trying their hardest
<strong>not</strong> to be something, than trying to <strong>be</strong> something. I fell into
this category for most of my life. I had no clue who I wanted to be,
but I knew very clearly what I did not. Fear is a great motivator,
and it&rsquo;s a perfectly valid way to approach the world (we all want to
survive, and be comfortable), but this drastically lowers one&rsquo;s learning
rate because the objective function simply to just stay afloat[1].</p><a href=#framework><h2 id=framework><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>framework</h2></a><p>I think there is a very straightforward way to build a self-regulating objective function,
but for some reason there isn&rsquo;t enough discourse about it that doesn&rsquo;t
devolve into &rsquo;take shrooms, go to the gym, meditate&rsquo; and I hate the notion
that you need to do anything besides simply being honest with yourself
about these things, at your current point of life:</p><ol><li><strong>who you are</strong></li><li><strong>what do you want to do</strong></li><li><strong>how are you going to do it</strong></li><li><strong>why are you doing it</strong></li><li><strong>what do you really care about</strong></li></ol><p>These questions are a subjective, &ldquo;human&rdquo; analogue to a Schmidhuber&rsquo;s
algorithmic framework (paraphrased):</p><ul><li>store everything</li><li>improve subjective compressibility [2]</li><li>let intrinsic curiosity reward reflect compression progress [3]</li><li>maximize intrinsic curiosity reward [4]</li></ul><p>To some extent, your <em>maximally compressed</em> world can be described as
<strong>what do you want to do</strong> and <strong>how are you going to do it</strong>,
<strong>who you are</strong> describes your starting point and learning rate,
and <strong>what do you really care about</strong> makes sure whatever you do aligns
with your internal value system.</p><p>The same system could be applied to building your startup, training your
dog, spending time with family and building relationships. As long as the
values align and you have an accurate estimate of your learning rate,
the only things needed are to follow the steps you outline. With each
environmental response, you recalibrate this function and simply keep going.</p><a href=#entitlement-ego-and-mindset><h2 id=entitlement-ego-and-mindset><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>entitlement, ego and mindset</h2></a><p>I haven&rsquo;t really talked about these before because from my perspective,
these are completely separate from the framework itself. There&rsquo;s a few different
points to be made about each:</p><ul><li>I don&rsquo;t think ego is bad. Trying to get anything done without the confidence
of knowing you can do it slows you down.</li><li>Similarly, being a little entitled can get things done, despite to the
annoyance of other people. It also comes naturally once your learning rate
is higher than your peers.</li><li>Your mindset is not your objective function, but it should change along with
it</li></ul><p>To put it simply, I see these things as tools to use in the right place and right
time. I certainly don&rsquo;t think these are necessary in <em>all</em> objective functions
(for ex: why would you want to be arrogant to a 1yr old you are trying to potty
train).</p><p>You could fake ego and entitlement, but I really don&rsquo;t think its necessary. If
you have a strongly thought out framework, you <em>will</em> know there is a
clear path with a high probability of success because you know <em>all</em> the relevant
rules, and you <em>know</em> exactly what to do to make it happen. Once you realize
nobody else has this information, what&rsquo;s there to fake?</p><a href=#notes><h2 id=notes><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>notes</h2></a><ol><li>Imo this problem affects immigrants non-trivially, and hence
we are so risk-averse</li><li>I take this as simplifying to things you care about</li><li>Ideally the more you explore, the simpler your compressed model of the
world should get because strip away irrelevant rules to your &lsquo;game&rsquo;</li><li>Higher the exploration gradient, the more you you are learning</li></ol></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/ data-ctx="Synthesizing Mental Models" data-src=/ class=internal-link>fuck</a></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://quartz.fuckpoasting.xyz/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>uwu</p><ul><li><a href=https://quartz.fuckpoasting.xyz/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/fuckpoasting>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/fuckpoasting>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
