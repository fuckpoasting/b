Ever since I was 14, I've had to make\na major life decision every ~2 years that would radically shape the\nway I perceive and interact with the world, but only the last two\ndecisions have been made based on a mental model that I forced\nmyself to sit down and stitch together based on my own set of values\nand beliefs.\n\nIt was prompted partially by a series of situations I got myself into\nduring the final year of university, which had me facing decision\nfatigue and existential dread. I care a lot about what I do with my\nlife, and choosing what to work on is, by principle, a big decision to me.\nTo simplify and inform my choice, I read through a bunch of blogs on\ntechno-optimism and ethics (reboot, gwern, noah smith etc), but mainly\nthis [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0812.4360.pdf) by Schmidhuber\n(mentioned I think in a geothotz interview) was a pretty impactful read.\n\nA lot of people try too hard to adapt generic value frameworks\nfrom the people around them and jam their entire life, psyche and\nambitions into it and hope it pays off. Now, I am not\nsaying you can't be inspired by other people, reflect and iterate on\nyour worldview but rather it is unlikely that someone else's framework\nis going to work for you, because you are completely different people.\nIt works for some people, but drastically fails for others.\n\nSome notable examples include:\n\n- Asians going to STEM / Indians going to IIT because\n  of their parents\n- Andrew Tate/Sigma Grindset gang\n\nThere's also another problem, where people are trying their hardest\n**not** to be something, than trying to **be** something. I fell into\nthis category for most of my life. I had no clue who I wanted to be,\nbut I knew very clearly what I did not. Fear is a great motivator,\nand it's a perfectly valid way to approach the world (we all want to\nsurvive, and be comfortable), but this drastically lowers one's learning\nrate because the objective function simply to just stay afloat[1].\n\n## framework\n\nI think there is a very straightforward way to build a self-regulating objective function,\nbut for some reason there isn't enough discourse about it that doesn't\ndevolve into 'take shrooms, go to the gym, meditate' and I hate the notion\nthat you need to do anything besides simply being honest with yourself\nabout these things, at your current point of life:\n\n1. **who you are**\n2. **what do you want to do**\n3. **how are you going to do it**\n4. **why are you doing it**\n5. **what do you really care about**\n\nThese questions are a subjective, \"human\" analogue to a Schmidhuber's\nalgorithmic framework (paraphrased):\n\n- store everything\n- improve subjective compressibility [2]\n- let intrinsic curiosity reward reflect compression progress [3]\n- maximize intrinsic curiosity reward [4]\n\nTo some extent, your _maximally compressed_ world can be described as\n**what do you want to do** and **how are you going to do it**,\n**who you are** describes your starting point and learning rate,\nand **what do you really care about** makes sure whatever you do aligns\nwith your internal value system.\n\nThe same system could be applied to building your startup, training your\ndog, spending time with family and building relationships. As long as the\nvalues align and you have an accurate estimate of your learning rate,\nthe only things needed are to follow the steps you outline. With each\nenvironmental response, you recalibrate this function and simply keep going.\n\n## entitlement, ego and mindset\n\nI haven't really talked about these before because from my perspective,\nthese are completely separate from the framework itself. There's a few different\npoints to be made about each:\n\n- I don't think ego is bad. Trying to get anything done without the confidence\n  of knowing you can do it slows you down.\n- Similarly, being a little entitled can get things done, despite to the\n  annoyance of other people. It also comes naturally once your learning rate\n  is higher than your peers.\n- Your mindset is not your objective function, but it should change along with\n  it\n\nTo put it simply, I see these things as tools to use in the right place and right\ntime. I certainly don't think these are necessary in _all_ objective functions\n(for ex: why would you want to be arrogant to a 1yr old you are trying to potty\ntrain).\n\nYou could fake ego and entitlement, but I really don't think its necessary. If\nyou have a strongly thought out framework, you _will_ know there is a\nclear path with a high probability of success because you know _all_ the relevant\nrules, and you _know_ exactly what to do to make it happen. Once you realize\nnobody else has this information, what's there to fake?\n\n## notes\n\n1. Imo this problem affects immigrants non-trivially, and hence\n   we are so risk-averse\n2. I take this as simplifying to things you care about\n3. Ideally the more you explore, the simpler your compressed model of the\n   world should get because strip away irrelevant rules to your 'game'\n4. Higher the exploration gradient, the more you you are learning\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-15T10:20:25.302651888Z","tags":null}}
